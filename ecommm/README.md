# React + Vite

This is a simple ecommerce project built using React Redux which fetches data from dummyjson api using Saga also has login/signup/logout features with the help of localStorage (storing data untill user manually deletes the data) also has admin dashboard , checkout page , order history page etc. Validations are also there if user is not logged in then user can't add items in cart .

For running this project download the zip file and open it in the VS Code and in the terminal enter this command "npm i" then "npm run dev" then the project will run successfully

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
